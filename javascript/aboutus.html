<p>Picasso Bistro & Pizzeria has been open since August of 2005. We are the only Pizzeria in Jackson TN that features an authentic stone hearth oven, the traditional Italian method of cooking pizzas. We also feature local art on our walls which are all for sale to help support local artists.

    As the first employee hired at Picasso James Salter took instant ownership of the restaurant and treated it as his own. James has been in the food service industry for over 17 years and started out in California at a prime butcher shop on Route 66 called Wolfe’s Market. James was fortunate enough to have met his wife Lindsay while working at Picasso.
    
    One of his regulars at the time, Dr. Baddour, approached him about forming a partnership. In September of 2007 Dr. Harry Baddour and James purchased Picasso. After maintaining a great working partnership for 3 years James and his wife Lindsay purchased the remaining stock of Picasso Bistro & Pizzeria from the Baddour’s.
    
    James & Lindsay have been working on perfecting the art of pizza ever since.
    
    They just recently added/renovated their bar area to better serve their customers and make it easier to get a table/seat easier.</p>
